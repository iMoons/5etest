					"Eagle feathers hold great significance according to these traditions. The nations of the Haudenosaunee confederacy use eagle feathers as a part of their ceremonial dress to denote which nation they belong to. Eagle feathers are also presented to people to mark great accomplishments or milestones in their lives, ranging from births to graduations to feats of bravery. ",
					"Among tribes in the Cherokee nation at the time of the Revolutionary war, warriors were presented with eagle feathers to wear to mark significant victories or accomplishments. Warriors adorned with many feathers were therefore highly skilled; those with the most feathers were usually war chiefs or in similar leadership roles. "

					"Highlanders were fearsome Scottish warriors, most of whom came to be allied with the British. After the failed Jacobite Rising in 1745, Parliament forbade the Scots from wearing tartan, speaking Gaelic, and other important cultural practices. In response, many Scottish families immigrated to Virginia and the Carolinas. ",
					"The British eventually relaxed these policies due to manpower shortages during the Seven Years’ War, allowing Highlanders recruits to go to war in kilt, bonnet, and full regalia. Whether out of a desire to practice their traditions openly, or simply for pay, many highland Scots enlisted. After serving in integrated units, some Scots began to feel a strong connection to the British identity. ",
					"By the time of the American Revolution many Highlanders felt a true loyalty to the crown, though some served the British forces under duress—after years of failed uprisings, many were in danger of lost titles or revoked land grants if they did not reestablish their name with the crown. For these reasons, Highlanders fought almost exclusively for the British cause."
